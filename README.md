# getTimeMachine

Simple Python script to autonomously mount a network drive and attached sparsebundle image for a Time Machine backup .

Simply replace the examples in the User Variables section with your existing details.

Run the script in the background on your Mac, and when you get to your home WiFi network (or whichever network your Network Device is on) the script will mount the device and the sparsebundle image and begin the backup.

For this example I used a Raspberry Pi as a network device on OS X 10.11
